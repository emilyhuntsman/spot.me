project using Spotify API for recommendations

This is just the beginning of my current project. As of now, I'm able to query three musical artists from the user and grab data including genres and pictures, from the API. My plan is to figure out how to use that data to create recommendations for the user in the future.


next:
allow user preferences to be used as criteria through sliders
include web player
carosel for recs

use local storage to keep track of previous playlists, keep data about artists, and track names

css: bootstrap
