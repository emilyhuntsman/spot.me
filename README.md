# spot.me

project using Spotify API for song and playlist recommendations at
https://root2point0.github.io/spot.me/

### Intro and User Stories
In thinking about this project, I wanted to practice using an api that had many, complex endpoints capable of taking many parameters that returns extremely nested json objects. I settled on Spotify because I had never worked with their data before, and I was curious about the ways in which they are able to generate recommedations within their interface. It was very interesting to dig into their documentation, receive an api key, and ultimately make a bunch of ajax calls to get the data I wanted. My goal in working on this was to make a user-friendly site with a logical flow to generate playlists based on three artists inputted by the user.

### Approach
My main focus in making the spot.me project was to keep the interface simple, extracting as much filtering data as possible from a straigtforward request from the user. To accomplish this, I used a search endpoint on the Spotify API to get each artist's corresponding id. Those three ids became my first three recommendation parameters. Each time the page is page is refreshed, a new token is checkout out through an ajax call, gauranteeing that it will never expire during a session. I then cross-referenced their artist genres, pulling any category that appeared in at least two of the three artists to use as another search query and operating on the assumption that they would be likely to enjoy artists from those genres. I also asked for two more pieces of information: if the user wants to filter out songs by their provided artists and if they'd rather see songs the might not have heard before. I worked the former into my sorting algorithm and the latter was used to set another "max-popularity" seed value. I displayed the resulting playlist along with a flip-through of the album covers. The app also implements local storage to keep the user's previous three playlists generated by the user.

### Implemented Using
Node.js, jQuery, ajax, Spotify API

### Next Steps
Potential next steps would be to look into adding a spotify web player that would have the most recently generated playlist pre-loaded for easy in-browser listening.
