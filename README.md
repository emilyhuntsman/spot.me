project using Spotify API for recommendations

This is just the beginning of my current project. As of now, I'm able to query three musical artists from the user and grab data including genres and pictures, from the API. My plan is to figure out how to use that data to create recommendations for the user in the future.


next:
generate refreshed token on page open
use artists id, common artist genres as seeds for recommendations
allow user preferences to be used as criteria through sliders
return list of five songs generated using API
include web player
carosel for recs

ask about code organization
naming of gihub account right now
